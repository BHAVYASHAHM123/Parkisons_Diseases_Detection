**Technology Used** : EDA, Feature Engineering, Scaling, Model Creation, Prediction, Pandas, Numpy


**Description** : In this project the process of identifying individuals with Parkinson's disease using data analysis and machine learning techniques. This data was extracted from Kaggle.

**Problem Statement** : Parkinson's disease (PD) is a central nervoussystem degenerative disease that affectsthe quality of life
of millions ofseniors around the world. Because of the variability of the condition,symptoms of Parkinson's disease might
progress differently from person to person. Patients with Parkinson's disease may experience tremors, which occur mostly
during rest. Tremorsin the hands, limb rigidity, and gait and balance issues are all possibilities. Generally, two types of
symptoms of PD can be distinguished: movement-related (i.e., motor) and unrelated to movement (non-motor). Patients
with non-motorsymptoms are actually more affected than those with motorsymptoms. Depression,sleep behavior
abnormalities, loss ofsmell, and cognitive impairment are examples of non-motorsymptoms. Itshould be mentioned that
early discovery of Parkinson's disease allowsfor faster treatment and a significant reduction in symptoms. As a result,
detecting PD at an early stage is critical forslowing its progression and, when available, may provide patients with the
opportunity to receive disease-modifying therapy.


**Approach** : Collect relevant data, pre-process and clean data, conduct exploratory data analysis, build predictive models,
evaluate model performance, and present results and insights.
